# Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to classic programming problems and problems solved at different online programming websites such as Hacker Rank, Codility, LeetCode and courses

## Courses

This MIT free course covers some of the most common algorithms and data structures. It assumes that you can write code in any programming language. I suggest you to watch the video and before looking at the implementation, try it yourself. Afterwards, you can compare your solution to the teacher's solution and see where you could have improved it.

## Websites where you can study

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codility](https://www.codility.com/)
- [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)

Want to try an environment that simulates a real interview ? [Coderpad](https://coderpad.io/) is a tool being used by multiple companies to apply algorithmic challenges to the candidates. Even though, in some ocasions you're not allowed to run your code.
